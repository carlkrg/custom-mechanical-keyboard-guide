- Stabilizer - Small components that provide stability and support for larger keys.

### Accessories: 
- Case Foam - An optional layer of foam placed between the case and the PCB to dampen sound and vibrations.
- Switch Lube - A lubricant used to reduce friction between switch components.
- Keycap Puller - A tool used for safely removing keycaps from the switches.
